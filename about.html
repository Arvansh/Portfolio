  <p>Hello everybody my name is Arvansh, author of this site and founder of Arvansh&trade;
     and Arvansh&copy;. I am a Fresher in the field of web devlopement. Currently all my websites
     are made completely in frontend languages like the HTML5, CSS and JavaScript(js). I am a fresher
     that means that I have only 2 weeks of experience. I got my all knowledge from Udemy and have a very
     less numbers of LeetCode problems. It is not a sponser but a tip for whom who wants learn 
     the Website devlopement. I prefer Udemy and I am not saying that you should use the Youtube 
     videos, they are very confusing specially to that type of people who wants more, in less efforts,
     and free of course. There are free courses too over Udemy but they are not informative than the paid
     versions. There are many kinds of websites that can help you with your web devlopement.</p>

  <p>I have a knowledge of HTML5 CSS and a few JavaScript(js) and I have a simple roadmap for them
     who wants to know about the web dev and want to develop the websites.</p>

  <ul>
    <div class="hc">
      <div class="html">

    <div class="css">
    <h3>CSS</h3>

    <li>Getting started with Css</li>
    <li>Selectors and types of selectors</li>
    <li>Basic styling</li>
    <li>Inline, Internal, and External CSS</li>

  </div>
</div>
    <p>Until these you would be able to make simple but not interactive pages.
      For Interacticity you need another Language commonly known as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <li>Alert boxes and their functionality when they are clicked</li>
    <li>Adding Inline Internal and External JavaScript</li>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Datatypes</li>
    <li>If - else and If-else_if-else</li>
    <li>loops</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Objects</li>
    <li>String Methods</li>
    <li>Document Object Model</li>
    <li>creating and removing elements</li>
    <li>Changing elements value</li>
    <li>Math object</li>
    <li>Date object</li>
    <li>Importing and Exporting</li>
    <li>Json files</li>
    <li>ES6</li>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>Map and sets</li>
    <li>API</li>
    <p>Untill now you can make high quality webpages.
       But still you can't get a job, for it you have to
       do React a js library and Tailwind Css framework.
       Or any other library and framework.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>After all this stuff you are a web dev</p>
  <p>And in whole of page you all still don't know who I am .</p>
